# This is our old selection, as used in the 2010 limits paper.
#
# The starting point is the (old) VBTF selection, which was documented
# at (dig in the history)
#
# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/VbtfZMuMuBaselineSelection
#
# We remove the cuts on muon pseudo-rapidity, change the isolation
# cut, and add cuts on the 3D angle between muons and the common
# vertex chi2 probability (the latter two being implemented in
# Zprime2muCompositeCandidatePicker, since they can't be done by the
# StringCutParser).
#
# So, both muons must pass this selection:
#
# - muon must be a global muon (isGlobalMuon)
# - cocktail pT > offline_pt_threshold
# - number of tracker hits >= 10 (innerTrack.hitPattern.numberOfValidTrackerHits >= 10)
# - relative tracker isolation less than 10% (isolationR03.sumPt / innerTrack.pt < 0.10)
#
# Then one muon must pass the above plus a tighter set of cuts:
#
# - |dxy wrt beamspot| < 0.2 cm (abs(dB) < 0.2)
# - muon global track chi2/ndof < 10 (globalTrack.normalizedChi2 < 10)
# - at least one pixel hit (innerTrack.hitPattern.numberOfValidPixelHits >= 1)
# - at least two muon stations in the fit (globalTrack.hitPattern.muonStationsWithValidHits >= 2)
# - must be a tracker muon (isTrackerMuon)
# - trigger matching to the single muon HLT path
#
# (The single muon HLT path used will change as the trigger menu
# evolves with luminosity; the details are kept in another file for
# multiple uses.)
#
# So we have a combiner that requires
# both muons to pass the loose cut, and at least one must pass the
# tight cut.
